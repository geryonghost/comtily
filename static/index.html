      <p>
        We have begun this project to help solve obscure problems related to how businesses operate within the US today.<br /><br />
        Businesses are run to make money. There is nothing wrong with that, except when there are no longer enough options to make a fair choice.
        Below you will see several projects that we have selected to focus our efforts on. They will hopefully take services that are "required" for 
        daily life and mix large amounts of technology to create an affordable alternative to big business.<br /><br />
        We are looking for potential investors (minimal return) and a lot of contributors while we build a viable product to help make this all happen.<br /><br />
        Here is a list of potential jobs one can contribue in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>UX Design</li>
        <li>Social Media, Marketing, Branding</li>
        <li>Sales</li>
        <li>Legal</li>
        <li>And much much more...</li>
      </ul>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Used Car Sales Ad Aggregator</h2>
        <h4>Problem: The big car sites focus on profits and how to make thsoe profits. That relies on dealers and private
        sellers to pay to post their cars on the sites.</h4>
        <p>
          We plan to create a partnership with dealerships where they send us (or we retreive) basic data about a car which we use to create an unbiased
          listing. This way each listing looks and feels exactly the same and the data speaks for itself. The consumer can then choose to visit the dealership
          website accordingly.<br /><br />
          I had this idea when searching for my vehicle. I had a very specific year, make, model, color, and options I wanted. Each site had different methods
          to search for this and it was hard. Some listings were on multiple sites, but look different. Some listings were only on one, but were missing
          important facts like photos or price. This didn't make me want to click into the dealers website, I simply skipped it. I did this for 6 months
          until I found the perfect match 1000 miles away. The dealership was excellent, but I bet there is an easier way. I also know that I am extreme, 
          but would like to make it easier for everyone to pick their desired car and find it whereever it is.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Cyber Security for Small Business</h2>
        <h4>Problem: Small Business can be affected by the same cyber criminals that big business can. However, the outcomes
        can be dramatically different. Most small businesses that are affected by cyber crime go out of business because it is too expensive to fix
        or their reputation is lost.
        </h4>
        <p>
          We plan to create a simple platform that is easy to understand, easy to install, and easy to mange for Small Businesses. The best part is
          if we keep profits out of it, the costs will not be astronomical for small businesses. At one point we had a good plan to keep automated 
          security updates, anti-malware, training, and backups to a minimal cost. But as a small business ourselves (and not good at sales or marketing) 
          we struggled to obtain enough customers to quit our day jobs.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Weather App</h2>
        <h4>Problem: Weather apps are very good at relaying the most common information to us. However, they miss very key 
          points that should be options like when does the daytime high occur or is it getting warmer or colder.
        </h4>
        <p>We would like to create a very simple application that works both on the web and phones/tablets that can be customized with information
          that others might not include or are hard to find. But front and cetner we want the current temp and whether or not the trend is going up or down.
          Here in northern Illinois knowing which direction the temperature is going is just as important as what it is. I don't want to look at the hourly
          forecasts for this simple information. Plus if it is 8 AM and the temperature is at its highest I want to know that without have to search for that.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Auto Insurance</h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <h4>Problem: There are a limited number of auto insurance companies that are not built for investor profit that cater to 
          the standard consumer. This makes profits the priority over the well being of the consumer. Think Bob Par from the Incredibles that does whatever
          it takes to help his customers and gets fired.
        </h4>
        <p>
          We would like to determine the feasibility to run a not for profit auto insurance company to meet the needs of the consumer. We know people
          that are being abused by the system. "A single parent with a teen driver and only one car paying more than a family with five cars and two 
          teenagers." Another example is "A retiree just under 70 paying more on a single car." We would like to be super transparent and let the consumer
          know exactly why they have the rate they have. Not simple and generic line items like "premium" and "discounts."
