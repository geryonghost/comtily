        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Social Media, Marketing, Branding</h2>
        <p>
          We have many good ideas, but our skills are limited. We are looking for people that can help is get the word out and optimize each of our
          project brands to make the most out of them.<br /><br />
          Desired skills:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Experience with as many social media platforms as possible</li>
            <li>Experience choosing naming, coloring, logos, and other branding aspects</li>
            <li>Experience in bringing in potential clients and working with technology to help meet their needs</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 25px;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">UX Design</h2>
        <p>
          As you can see from this absurdly plain website, we are in the need of a solid UX design. This opportunities will work with branding
          to create the proper UX for each project.<br /><br />
          Desired skills:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>We do not know exactly what we need here. Make suggestions</li>
        </p>
      </div>

    <div style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px; display: flex;">
      <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 25px;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Sales</h2>
        <p>
          We have ideas, we have product (very basic at this time), but we do not have customers. This opportunity will work with the social media 
          and marketing contributors to be the final point of contact for acquiring new customers. Some of the projects will hopefully be more self
          service, while others will require a more hands on approach. We have not decided on locales for as our primary focus. A target market could
          be Illinois, but if that is a harder market to break in to we can decide to do it later.<br /><br />
          Desired skills:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Experience reaching out to local businesses for B2B services</li>
            <li>Experience with consumer centric sales</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 25px;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Legal</h2>
        <p>
          We are not legal in any way shape and form yet. We want to be totally honest and forthcoming about how we operate and pass that knowledge
          to our customers, partners, and everyone else. There will be work related to privacy policies, terms of service, liability insurance (not sure
          if that is legal), and much more. Reach out for more details.
